COVID-19 Data Analysis
1. Population and Weekly Incidence (Top 20 Countries)
   
The left chart shows the total population of the selected countries, while the right chart shows the average number of new COVID-19 cases over the last seven days normalized per 100,000 inhabitants. These charts demonstrate that a high incidence rate is not directly related to the absolute size of the population.

Comparing these two charts confirms that a large population does not automatically imply a higher infection rate. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor indicators normalized to population size.

2. Relationship Between Population Size and COVID-19 Incidence

The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's population size and its average number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The visualization suggests that there is no strong linear dependence between these two variables.

3. Linear Regression Fit
   
A linear regression line was added to the scatter plot to provide a simple approximation of the relationship between population size and COVID-19 incidence. The fitted line indicates only a weak linear trend.

4. Residual Analysis

The residual histogram shows the distribution of differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear regression model. A fitted normal distribution is overlaid to assess whether the residuals follow an approximately normal distribution, which is an important assumption of linear regression.
