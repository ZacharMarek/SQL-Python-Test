<h1>COVID-19 Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>1. Population and Weekly Incidence (Top 20 Countries)</h2>
<p>
The left chart shows the total population of the selected countries, while the right chart
shows the average number of new COVID-19 cases over the last seven days
normalized per 100,000 inhabitants. These charts demonstrate that a high incidence
rate is not directly related to the absolute size of the population.
</p>

Comparing these two charts confirms that a large population does not automatically imply a higher infection rate. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor indicators normalized to population size.
<h2>2. Relationship Between Population Size and COVID-19 Incidence</h2>
<p>
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's population size and
its average number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The visualization
suggests that there is no strong linear dependence between these two variables.

<h2>3. Linear Regression Fit</h2>
<p>
A linear regression line was added to the scatter plot to provide a simple approximation
of the relationship between population size and COVID-19 incidence. The fitted line
indicates only a weak linear trend.

<h2>4. Residual Analysis</h2>
<p>
The residual histogram shows the distribution of differences between the observed values
and the values predicted by the linear regression model. A fitted normal distribution
is overlaid to assess whether the residuals follow an approximately normal distribution,
which is an important assumption of linear regression.
